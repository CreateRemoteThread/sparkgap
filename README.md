HAPPYMEAL EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH

These tools should be used in a workflow. A quick start workflow is documented [here](docs/quickstart.md), and more documentation can be found in the docs/ folder. You should also read [this](docs/quickstart-dev.md) to extend the framework.

The code is provided as-is, pull requests welcome :)
